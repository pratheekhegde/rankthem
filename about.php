	<td><p><big>Hi! Greetings from our team,</big><br><br>
	Okay now that you have opened this page, lets talk about it. First of all we are a clique with crazy minds. It was someday back ago this idea of recreating <b><u><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=facemash" target=blank>
	Facemash</a></u></b> came to our minds.
	Our version of <b><u><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=facemash" target=blank>Facemash</a></u></b> was kinda different. We didn't want to be offensive nor we didn't want to hurt anyone, so we started with this voting
	system, where you vote your favourite ones based on your interests. You also get to know all the faces around you. All of this is just for <b>entertainment</b>. We don't know how long this website will survive, It could die tomorrow or even the next immediate minute[LMFAO].
	We gathered the victims list from some sources;designed a simple,decent interface;acquired a few free hosting servers and published the site. Actually
	everything happened in one night[:p].<b><font color=red><h2>WE OWN THE RIGHTS FOR ALL OF THE CONTENTS, INCLUDING THE CODE. THIS IS OUR ORIGINAL WORK.</h2></font></b></p>
	So Technically,<br>
	<ul>
		<li>We used only HTML for the frontend interfacing.</li>
		<li>Little bit of CSS here and there.</li>
		<li>PHP,SQL backend.</li>
		<li>For Graphics we worked with MS Paint(Yes, we really did).
		<li><b>bullseye</b> does the data accumulation.</li>
		<li><b>skinreaper</b> does the database manipulation.</li>
		<li><b>garbage69</b> does the coding.</li>
		<li>We swap our works sometimes.</li>
		<li>When we get the raw data, we process it and push it to our servers.</li>
		<li>Our Servers:<ul>
						<li><a href=http://rankthem.my-style.in target=blank>Server0</a> - rankthem.my-style.in</li>
						<li><a href=http://rankthem1.my-style.in target=blank>Server1</a> - rankthem1.my-style.in(Backup Server)</li>
						</ul>
						</li>
		<li>We get to squash bugs every alternate days.(The famous one is <u>browser-back-button-bug</u>[LOL].)</li>
		<li>We increment our<font color=red><b> Build</b></font> whenever we have a major code revision.</li>
		<li>Boring stuffs we know..[LOL]</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	We have created a system and we are trying to follow it and that's what we believe in. If you'd like to share a hand with our work you're always welcome.
	If you really appreciate our work, all we request you to do is give us your valuable feedbacks(just drop it to our mailbox <b>rankthem@mail.com</b> or if you know us give it to us personally). We are not here
	to trouble or intentionally cause some inconvenience to any of the victims. We've got lots of ideas to implement in the coming days and we are counting on it[:)].<br>
	You can also send your feedback through this form below.<br><br>
